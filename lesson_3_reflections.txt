When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I would want to publish my project in order to make it possilbe for collaboration 
    of other members on it, code review, project sharing or simply make a cloud backup copy 
    of my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to control when to pull content and what branch to pull from my remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone copies repository from GitHub to local (or from local to local).
    Fork copies repository from GitHub to GitHub. Branch splits current repository
    (local or remote) on two branches. I will use fork to make a remote copy while
    preserving reference towards original. Clone can den be used to copy forked repository 
    to local or to copy from local to local. Branch will be used when wanting to make 
    a version of current repository which could be possible merge again with original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That way we are able to determine if the remote repository has some new commits since we 
    have last time fetched from it. This makes it possible to decide whether merge commit or  
    fast forward commit will be applied.
